# Group-Project
## Files:
- try.ipynb (everything about the code, including the plot)
- turn_to_py.py (the finished version of code, and saved as py.file )
- Multiprocess.ipynb (to do the parallel, me need to import the turn_to_py.py above.)

## Steps:
- 1. Open turn_to_py.py, set the parameters(iteration numbers, tabu list size and size), the number was found in the plot.
- 2. Open the Multiprocess.ipynb. Build a new `city_list` contain 30 different routes(different from the start and end cities.)
- 3. Do the parallel by using the Multiprocess package. 
- 4. Parallel the `turn_to_py.parallelfunc` with `city_list`
- 5. It returns a list which contain 30 optimal answers (best answer for each routes)
- 6. At end, `finalanswer` helps find the best amoung these 30 answers. and return the star-end city number, the travel distacne and route.

## Details:
- Open try.ipynb
